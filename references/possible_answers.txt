attributes could be filled:
          : free text (nothing speficied)
        rl: reference list
        bool: yes/no
        yyyy-mm-dd: date
        if no answer is given: NULL
        if no answer can be given: VOID
        if the answer is that it is planned to provide a solution: planned
        if you should use a reference list but your answer is negative: none
        if answer is defined bool, it is also possible to use: partially
per attribute you could have one or more answers:
            : only one (nothing specified)
        1..*: more than one possible
        ?: still to be decided
nested attribute definitions: each indentation means that for each attribute value we need additional specifications.
