        ONLY in dev accepted: 
        '?' behind the answer indicating that this has to be checked
        indication of question number like 2.1 
        
        -> in descriptions: 
        ? has to be deleted, decide whether NULL or just the answer as given
        question number has to be replaced by NULL
                
        ---
